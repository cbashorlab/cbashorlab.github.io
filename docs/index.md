## WHAT WE DO

***The goal of our work is to use synthetic regulatory circuits to reprogram the behavior of human cells.***{:.center}

## OUR RESEARCH

### The Bashor Lab

Using the tools of **synthetic biology**, we construct artificial regulatory circuits and test their function in living cells. This not only gives us insight into the design logic of natural regulation, but also allows us to predictively alter cellular phenotype to create cell-based translational applications.

### Synthetic Gene Circuitry

Our work explores the fundamentals of gene expression control in mammalian cells. By leveraging multi-scale chromatin regulation, our engineering approach allows us to encode stable, precise control over complem artificial gene expression programs that can be used to report on and also reprogram cellular behavior.

### Synthetic Signaling Pathway

we are interested in engineering post-translational circuits that **sense**, **compute**, and **respond** to extracellular inputs. These circuits serve as model systems for understanding the molecular and biophysical determinants of signal transduction, and can be used to programmably control how a cell interacts with its enwironment.

### High-Throughput Circuit Engineering

One of our goals is to increase the pace and scale of synthetic circuit engineering. We are creating experimental pipelines that use iterative rounds of circuit library construction and testing to systematically and comprehensively discover circuit design principles.

### Engineering Cell-Based Therapies

By introducing synthetic regulatory programs that encode for functions like sense and response, secretion, movement, or differentiation, we can reshape how cells interact with their environment. Using our circuit engineering toolkit, we aim to impart relevant cell types with new behavioral features, transforming them into agents capable of fighting disease.
